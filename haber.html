<h3 class="pop-up">Raw Materials for the Haber-Bosch Process</h3>

<p class="pop-up"><strong>Worldwide:</strong> The Haber-Bosch process requires nitrogen (N₂) from the air and hydrogen (H₂), which is most commonly produced from natural gas (methane, CH₄) via steam methane reforming or from water via electrolysis. Iron (Fe) is used as a catalyst, often with promoters like potassium hydroxide (KOH), to enhance reaction efficiency. The process also requires high pressure and temperature to produce ammonia efficiently.</p>

<p class="pop-up"><strong>In Kazakhstan:</strong> In Kazakhstan, nitrogen is obtained from the air, and hydrogen is mainly derived from the country’s abundant natural gas reserves. Local ammonia plants, especially in regions like Atyrau and Pavlodar, use iron-based catalysts for the reaction, with high-pressure and high-temperature reactors tailored for large-scale ammonia production.</p>

<h3 class="pop-up">Usage of Ammonia</h3>

<p class="pop-up"><strong>Worldwide:</strong> Ammonia produced via the Haber-Bosch process is mainly used for fertilizers such as urea and ammonium nitrate, which are essential for global agriculture. It is also used in cleaning products, explosives, plastics, refrigerants, and various chemical syntheses in industry.</p>

<p class="pop-up"><strong>In Kazakhstan:</strong> In Kazakhstan, ammonia is primarily used for domestic fertilizer production and exported to neighboring countries. It also finds applications in local industrial processes, cleaning products, and refrigeration systems, supporting agriculture and manufacturing sectors.</p>

<h3 class="pop-up">Ecological Consequences</h3>

<p class="pop-up"><strong>Worldwide:</strong> The production and use of ammonia consumes large amounts of energy, mainly from fossil fuels, contributing to global CO₂ emissions. Overuse of ammonia-based fertilizers can cause nutrient runoff into rivers and lakes, leading to water pollution, algal blooms, and eutrophication. Ammonia emissions into the atmosphere can contribute to air pollution, affecting ecosystems and human health.</p>

<p class="pop-up"><strong>In Kazakhstan:</strong> Ammonia production in Kazakhstan is concentrated in industrial regions like Atyrau and Pavlodar. Local environmental impacts include potential air pollution from ammonia plants and fertilizer factories. Improper fertilizer management can lead to soil and water contamination, affecting agriculture and natural ecosystems in nearby areas.</p>
